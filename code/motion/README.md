# Implementing your own motion detection model
You can implement additional models of your choice in this folder. It must have the model files loadable in PyTorch, as well as a script for training. You can check how the models like RAFT are implemented and set up a similar pipeline. Some parts in the codes for training and tracking in "GPI-blob-tracking/code" should also be changed accordingly.
